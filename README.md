# Open Source Help Wanted Projects

The purpose of this repo is to maintain a list of open source projects by language that allow for the community to quickly indentify areas they can contribute.  This is very helpful for individuals that are new to a language.  I'm also hoping this will be used for hackathons and meetups.
